# First Aid Git
## Command Line Interface

This is the experimental CLI for an even faster access to the [firstaidgit.io](http://firstaidgit.io) content.
Search through the most common Git issues and quickly find an answer good enough to solve them.

## Install

`npm install -g firstaidgit`

## Usage

From your terminal, run `firstaidgit` followed by `your query`

`firstaidgit <question you want answered>`

Without the `<>`. An example of this could be:

`firstaidgit undo commit before push`

You'll be presented with all issues that match your query.

## Problems / Issues

Since this is still in very early stages and it's my first CLI package, please submit any issues by opening a ticket on the Github project or by dropping me a tweet about it at [magalhini](http://www.twitter.com/magalhini)
